# MUD-HttpsLocal
Concerns on use of MUD for HttpsLocal's DNS

##Usecase
-Situation
--To access devices(e.g. cameras) at local network by a browser (e.g. smartphone) without rendezvous point at Internet.

-target
--We want secure communication without modifying Trust-store of browser. 

-Requirement]
--Certificates for local devices need to be issued from public trusted CA .

-solution
--Those devices will have local address, and FQDN under device vender’s Domain namespace.(So that, we do not need global Ip for public trusted EE certificate)
—————————————————————————————
## the method of importing certificates into devices is out of scope here
